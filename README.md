## Probem description
The aim of the project is to develop an octaver using the SuperCollider programming language. The octaver  mixes the input signal with a synthesised signal whose musical tone is one octave lower or higher than the original.
## GUI
### Control knobs
*  Dry/Wet Knob: controls amount of the original dry input signal that is let through unaltered.
*   The Octave Up/Down Knob: controls how much of the ”wet” signal will be composed of the lower or the upper octave signal. Turning the knob completely to the left (minimum value) will output only the lower octave, while turning it completely to the right (maximum value) will output only the upper one. 
*   Amplitude knob: controls the total output volume
*   Chorus knobs: control the parameters of the chorus applied to the signal
### Polyphonic - Monophonic button
Allows the user select which algorithm will be employed to synthesise the wet signal. When the switch is off the effect acts in Monophonic mode, delivering a more vintage sound which mimics the one produced by classic analogue octaver pedals. The Polyphonic mode offers a less interesting and more ”pitch- shifting”-like digital sound, though it is able to handle chords.
